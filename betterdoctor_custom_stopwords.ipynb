This was quite rewarding, especially in helping me to understand the importance of working closely with other practitioners. The best care was achieved by working together including with the various therapists and counselors who provided many hours of service to meet the needs of the patients.  Since leaving the hospital setting and building a private practice over the past 17 years, I've continued to apply this fundamental principle of patient care. Often, patients are referred by their therapist (ie., psychologist, CSW, MSW, RN) for medication evaluation and treatment. Or, a patient may be referred by his/her primary care physician or another specialist for the same reason. In either case, after meeting with the patient and completing my initial evaluation (which lasts between 60 and 75 minutes), I strive to coordinate care with the referring practitioner. After receiving the patient's written authorization, I call the therapist or physician directly and discuss important treatment matters, including medications recommended and/or started. The goal is the coordinated care to achieve the best overall treatment for each individual patient.  When a prospective patient calls the office seeking evaluation and/or treatment, I speak directly with that person in order to establish an initial rapport and address any questions asked. This often reduces any initial discomfort and encourages the individual to discuss his/her questions and ideas openly right from the start. In order to have a successful treatment, it is most important that the patient feels comfortable talking freely and thoroughly during their sessions.  My office is located in midtown Manhattan, on Fifth Avenue, across from the Empire State Building. The waiting room is spacious and supplied with plenty of magazines and a water cooler. The office itself is designed to create a comfortable living room-like setting to provide the best environment for the discussion of the important issues that each patient brings in with him/her.\", \"Dr. Arkady Bilenko, MD, specialist in psychiatry, currently practices medicine at Brooklyn, New York.

This was quite rewarding, especially in helping me to understand the importance of working closely with other practitioners. The best care was achieved by working together including with the various therapists and counselors who provided many hours of service to meet the needs of the patients.  Since leaving the hospital setting and building a private practice over the past 17 years, I've continued to apply this fundamental principle of patient care. Often, patients are referred by their therapist (ie., psychologist, CSW, MSW, RN) for medication evaluation and treatment. Or, a patient may be referred by his/her primary care physician or another specialist for the same reason. In either case, after meeting with the patient and completing my initial evaluation (which lasts between 60 and 75 minutes), I strive to coordinate care with the referring practitioner. After receiving the patient's written authorization, I call the therapist or physician directly and discuss important treatment matters, including medications recommended and/or started. The goal is the coordinated care to achieve the best overall treatment for each individual patient.  When a prospective patient calls the office seeking evaluation and/or treatment, I speak directly with that person in order to establish an initial rapport and address any questions asked. This often reduces any initial discomfort and encourages the individual to discuss his/her questions and ideas openly right from the start. In order to have a successful treatment, it is most important that the patient feels comfortable talking freely and thoroughly during their sessions.  My office is located in midtown Manhattan, on Fifth Avenue, across from the Empire State Building. The waiting room is spacious and supplied with plenty of magazines and a water cooler. The office itself is designed to create a comfortable living room-like setting to provide the best environment for the discussion of the important issues that each patient brings in with him/her.\", \"Dr. Arkady Bilenko, MD, specialist in psychiatry, currently practices medicine at Brooklyn, New York.

This was quite rewarding, especially in helping me to understand the importance of working closely with other practitioners. The best care was achieved by working together including with the various therapists and counselors who provided many hours of service to meet the needs of the patients.  Since leaving the hospital setting and building a private practice over the past 17 years, I've continued to apply this fundamental principle of patient care. Often, patients are referred by their therapist (ie., psychologist, CSW, MSW, RN) for medication evaluation and treatment. Or, a patient may be referred by his/her primary care physician or another specialist for the same reason. In either case, after meeting with the patient and completing my initial evaluation (which lasts between 60 and 75 minutes), I strive to coordinate care with the referring practitioner. After receiving the patient's written authorization, I call the therapist or physician directly and discuss important treatment matters, including medications recommended and/or started. The goal is the coordinated care to achieve the best overall treatment for each individual patient.  When a prospective patient calls the office seeking evaluation and/or treatment, I speak directly with that person in order to establish an initial rapport and address any questions asked. This often reduces any initial discomfort and encourages the individual to discuss his/her questions and ideas openly right from the start. In order to have a successful treatment, it is most important that the patient feels comfortable talking freely and thoroughly during their sessions.  My office is located in midtown Manhattan, on Fifth Avenue, across from the Empire State Building. The waiting room is spacious and supplied with plenty of magazines and a water cooler. The office itself is designed to create a comfortable living room-like setting to provide the best environment for the discussion of the important issues that each patient brings in with him/her.\", \"Dr. Arkady Bilenko, MD, specialist in psychiatry, currently practices medicine at Brooklyn, New York.
